# Advanced Software Engineering: TrialNError AppCom

## Introduction

### Motivation
Currently, people simply download the mobile apps which are available to them depending on the operating system of the 
smartphone they use. However, some mobile apps are not available in all app stores. Moreover, an app may have better 
performance and user rating on a specific operating system (iOS vs. Android). Therefore, it makes sense to turn 
around the traditional approach and thus offer consumers the possibility to choose the smartphone they 
want depending on the mobile apps they would like to later install on it.

### Idea and Overview
Our idea is to develop a web application, which will act as a mobile app aggregator. The web application will provide 
users with an overview of different mobile apps out there (for our project, scope will be limited to apps in Google Play
Store and Apple App Store). After signing in on the website, users will be able to select the apps which interest them 
(based on various information, e.g., price, rating, etc.) and add them to their personal “Apps list”. Users will be able 
to create multiple “Apps lists”. When viewing a specific “Apps list”, users will see various visualizations 
(portion of iOS apps vs portion of Android apps; breakdown of apps according to types – entertainment, news, education, etc.). 
This should make it easier for users to decide whether their future smartphone should run on iOS or Android and which 
apps exactly should they install on it. In addition, in each “Apps list” complementary app recommendations will be shown. 
Those recommendations will be based on the selected apps in the “Apps list”, using a content-filtering technique.
